# Sales Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting sales based on retail outlet and product data.

## Overview

The sales prediction model utilizes a dataset consisting of various features such as item identifiers, weights, types, visibility, maximum retail prices (MRP), outlet identifiers, establishment years, sizes, locations, types, and actual sales figures.

## Files

- **SalesPrediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire pipeline from data cleaning to model evaluation.
- **Train.csv** and **Test.csv**: CSV files containing training and testing datasets.
- **app.py**: Streamlit web application for interactive sales predictions.
- **requirements.txt**: Dependencies required to run the project.
- **sales_prediction_model.pkl**: Serialized machine learning model stored in pickle format.

## Live Demo

## Steps to Build the Model

1. **Import Libraries and Frameworks**: Set up necessary tools including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
   
2. **Load and Read Datasets**: Import data from Train.csv and Test.csv for training and validation.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Explore datasets for insights.
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Address any irregularities and outliers in the data.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze distributions and correlations using uni-variate, bi-variate, and multivariate techniques.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Label encode and one-hot encode categorical features.
   - Transform and scale numerical features as necessary.

6. **Model Selection and Evaluation**:
   - Choose regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE or R-squared.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance by tuning parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

8. **Feature Importance and Model Deployment**:
   - Extract feature importance to understand which factors most influence sales predictions.
   - Save the final model (sales_prediction_model.pkl) for future predictions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction-model.git
   cd sales-prediction-model
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Access the app in your browser at `localhost:8501`.
